## Arena setup
### Common steps
Use these steps to register the arena and attach the module:

- `/baa create [id] <standalone|party>` — Create a new arena in standalone or party mode.
- `/baa arena [id] setname [name]` — Give the arena a friendly display name.
- `/baa arena [id] setlobby` — Set the lobby spawn for the arena.
- `/baa arena [id] minplayers [amount]` — Define the minimum players required to start.
- `/baa arena [id] maxplayers [amount]` — Define the maximum players allowed.
- `/baa game [arena_id] add [minigame]` — Attach this minigame module to the arena.
- `/baa stick` — Get the setup tool to select regions.
- `/baa game [arena_id] [minigame] bounds set` — Save the game bounds for this arena.
- ~~`/baa game [arena_id] [minigame] spawn add`~~ — Not used in Bed Wars.
  Use **`/baa game [arena_id] bed_wars team spawn <team_id>`** to configure team spawns.
- ~~`/baa game [arena_id] [minigame] time [minutes]`~~ — Not used in Bed Wars.
  The match ends when only one team remains alive.

### Module-specific steps
Finish the setup with the commands below:

#### 1. Configure teams
- `/baa game [arena_id] bed_wars team count <value>` — Set the number of teams (minimum 2).
- `/baa game [arena_id] bed_wars team size <value>` — Set the players per team (minimum 1 for solo, 2+ for teams).
- `/baa game [arena_id] bed_wars team spawn <team_id>` — Set the spawn point for a team at your current location.

#### 2. Configure beds
- `/baa game [arena_id] bed_wars bed set <team_id>` — Set the bed for a team. Look at the bed block and run this command.

#### 3. Configure resource spawners
- `/baa game [arena_id] bed_wars spawner add <iron|gold|diamond|emerald> <true|false>` — Add a spawner. Look at the block where the spawner should be and run this command. The second argument controls whether a hologram is shown above the spawner (`true` or `false`). Spawn intervals are configured globally in `settings.yml` under `spawners.defaults.*` — they are not set per-spawner.
- `/baa game [arena_id] bed_wars spawner list` — Show all configured spawners (type and hologram flag).
- `/baa game [arena_id] bed_wars spawner remove` — Remove a spawner. Look at the spawner block and run this command. Breaking a spawner block during gameplay also unregisters it.

#### 4. Configure shop NPCs
- `/baa game [arena_id] bed_wars npc add <store|upgrade>` — Add a shop NPC at your current location. NPCs are villagers that spawn when the game starts and despawn when it ends. `store` opens the item shop menu, `upgrade` opens the team upgrades menu.
- `/baa game [arena_id] bed_wars npc list` — Show all configured NPCs.
- `/baa game [arena_id] bed_wars npc remove <id>` — Remove an NPC by its ID.

#### 5. Configure region
- `/baa game [arena_id] bed_wars region set` — Select and save the regeneration region.
- `/baa game [arena_id] bed_wars region clear` — Clear the regeneration region if needed.

> **Important:** `team_id` values are numeric-only (`1`, `2`, `3`, ...) and must be between `1` and your configured `team count`.
